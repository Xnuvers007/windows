For very old systems (Windows 2000) without reg.exe and getmac.exe, copy them from English Windows XP/2003 and paste them here.

For choice.exe, copy it from Windows Server 2003.

Note: choice.exe is optional, while reg.exe and getmac.exe are required, but should be available in the OS unless you use Windows 2000 or a customized Windows PE
